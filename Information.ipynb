There are  4 different ticket categories with 4 different prices, namely 9, 12, 15 and 19 Euro. The challenge is to find an optimal assignment of seats to ticket prices that maximises the expected revenue. For instance, a possible assignment could look like this (note that all assigned seats sum up to the capacity, i.e. 50 seats):\n",

    "With the assignment given above, the first 5 customers that book a ticket for this bus ride would have to pay 9 Euro. Then, the subsequent 20 customers would pay 12 Euro, since the contingent of 9 Euro tickets has already been used up (and so on). All seats are equal, i.e. the customer receives the same product, no matter if she had to pay 9 Euro or 19 Euro for the ticket.

For example, imagine we know that $Q=100$ customers want to buy a ticket for 9 Euro. From the curve, we see that $f(x=18) \\approx 0.2$, so we can deduce that $0.2 \\cdot 100 = 20$ customers out of those 100 would also buy a ticket for 18 Euro. Conversely, if we know that 20 customers want to buy a ticket for 18 Euro, we can infer that the total demand for 9 Euro tickets is actually $Q=20/0.2 = 100$."

You may justify this assumption as follows: Customers who want to get cheap tickets order way in advance, whereas customers who need a ticket urgently for a bus ride that departs soon are willing to pay higher prices.\n",
